# T.I.A.N.

What is T.I.A.N.[^1]
-
T.I.A.N. is an experimentation with machine learning, specifically object recognition and text recognition. The project is written entirely in Python and utilizing standard libraries such as NumPy and originally, the project had used a library known as PyTesseract[https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/] in order to process the text, however, this felt like it was cheating, so I wanted to create and train my own OCR model instead of riding off of the Google Tesseract OCR engine.

Applications of T.I.A.N.
-
A video game that I played a lot with my friends one summer was a game that had focused entirely on syllables. It was known as BombParty[https://jklm.fun/][^2]. I enjoyed the game a lot and wanted to ruin the fun for the people around me[^3]. I began to train the OCR model to recognize the syllables within the game and thus; the bot was born.

### Foot Notes
[^1]: T.I.A.N. stands for Text (and) Image Aggregation Neuron. This is also the name of my favorite stuffed animal. (see image)[]
[^2]: In this game, you were given a syllable randomly and you had to provide a word that had contained this syllable. 
[^3]: This is a joke, I love my friends (maybe).
